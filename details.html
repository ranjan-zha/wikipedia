        <h1 class="phead">History of Google</h1> <br>
        <h4 class="phead">The Google By Lawrence Edward Page</h4> <br>
        <p>
          Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students 
          at Stanford University in California.The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", 
          Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, 
          but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics 
          and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.<br>

            <br> Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at 
            Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly-listed shares and control 56% of 
            the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. 
            In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a
             holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, 
             replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.<br>
            <br>
            The company's rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine, 
            (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling 
            and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Google Duo, Google Chat, and Google Meet), 
            language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts),
             video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Jamboard), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). 
             The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS (a lightweight, 
             proprietary operating system based on the free and open-source Chromium OS operating system). Google has moved increasingly into hardware; 
             from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple 
             hardware products in 2016, including the Google Pixel line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh wireless router. 
             Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber and Google Fi).
